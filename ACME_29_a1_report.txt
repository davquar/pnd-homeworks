3. Initial brainstorming (where you write your considerations about what to do and how)
	After a brief introduction to the network topology and the tools used to handle 
	the machines (Proxmox), we reasoned all togheter in depth on the ways to better
	configure the network. 
	The best solution appeared to be the step by step approach: i.e. starting from 
	configuring the main router, then the neighbour subnetwork (External and DMZ), 
	finally the internal firewall with the Internal and Clients network.
	For the procedures we choose to follow the one described in the assignment, 
	since the proposed tool appeared to work properly to succesfully complete all
	the requests.

4.	Setup of the infrastructure for IPv6 addressing (here you should detail the 
	steps you’ve done to properly setup all the hosts. You should also include 
	details and explanation about the network structure you opted for and any 
	difficulties you’ve faced and –hopefully– solved)
